It is used to center and focus the team at the beginning, keep the team on track during the effort, and is used to validate that the effort delivered an outcome that solves the problem statement. It has a specific form:
								<ul>
                               <li>Vision - what does the world look like if we solve the problem?</li>
                               <li>Issue Statement - one or two sentences that describe the problem using specific issues. It is not a "lack of a solution" statement. For example, our problem is that we don't have an ERP system.</li>
							<li>Method - the process that will get followed to solve the problem. For example, DMAIC or Kaizen.</li>
